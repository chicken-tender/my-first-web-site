<h2>Welcome My Homepage !! </h2>
<p>the area or position that someone is in:<br>
    She keeps looking in my direction.<br>
    As they spoke they kept glancing in my direction.<br>
    He nudged his friend and nodded in my direction.<br>
    I thought I saw them pointing in our direction.<br>
    He got up and started heading in my direction.<br>
    Hearing my footsteps, they both turned in my direction.</p>
